# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds.  The problem is that the gradient may not render as expected, or might show completely different colors compared to the intended output. This could be due to several factors such as incorrect syntax, conflicting styles, or missing dependencies.

## Problem

The provided code attempts to create a gradient background using `bg-gradient-to-r` along with color classes, but it may display incorrectly in some environments.  This might manifest as a solid color instead of a gradient, incorrect color transitions, or unexpected color values. 

## Solution

The solution involves checking for any potential conflicts or issues in the Tailwind configuration file or other CSS styles that might be overriding the gradient styling. It also ensures proper usage of the gradient utility classes.  Additionally, verifying that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and installed is important.
